# Notes

- Training ResNet (postactivation) almost saturates the train accuracy in 40 epochs. But training resnet v2 doesn't saturate it.
- What we increase the number of channels for res net v2 to 64 from 32. Also increasing epochs to 80 gave accuracy of 95.22%

- Actually there is a bug in my resnet v2 implementation. I was not passing identity path cleanly.

```py

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.bn1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        identity = out

        out = self.conv1(x) # This should be out instead of x
        out = self.bn2(out)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.conv2(out)

        out += self.shortcut(identity) # This should be x instead of identity
        return out
```
