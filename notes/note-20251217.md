# Neural Net training debug

Questions we can ask

- Saturation of training accuracy but test accuracy is low

  - Does the model have sufficient parameters?

- Are gradients healthy?

- Is learning rate appropriate?

  - What's ratio of gradient w.r.t to wieghts?
  - What's ratio of update w.r.t to wieghts?

- Are activations well behaved?

- Are predictions confidently correct?
